# 100days
project collections about me tryhard understanding more html,css & javascript

#   Why there is some day that skipped
- That means i do my passive learning (not doing a project) on that day, i just read some article/info about front end related or watching some tutorial

#   File naming : 
## With At (@)
 Vue folder project name cannot contain hash symbol (#) (for build purpose) so i just changed it to at symbol (@) 
- @day_file-name (framework_name). e.g -> @64 DevChallenges - My Gallery (Vue)

## With Hash (#)
- #day_file-name. e.g -> (#3_This is from day 3)
- #day,day,day_file-name. e.g -> (#6,7,8 CSS Grid Practice)
